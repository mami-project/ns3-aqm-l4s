traffic-control
Move to folder ns-3.xx/src/
Contains AQM implementations

ipv4-queue-disc-item.cc/.h
Move to ns-3.xx/src/internet/model
Contains implementation of ECN marking (was not yet included in 3.26)

ptr.h
Move to ns-3.xx/src/core/model
Contains function to freely move pointers
Necessary for LTE simulations where the connection between the two queues (bearers) is set up by moving pointers around

lte-rlc-um.c/.h
Move to ns-3.xx/src/lte
Contains AQM implementations for LTE

my-sims
Move to ns-3-dce/myscripts
Contains simulation set-ups for normal and LTE case
Paramters for static channel simulations are given through ns-3 interface (see lines 133-144 from my-sims/my-sims.py).
Some parameters for LTE simulations are given through ns-3 interface as well. AQM parameters have to be given through command promt at runtime. Paramters always have to be given in the form a,b,c,d,e,f as a string
a=L4S used [0,1]
b=PIE or RED [0 (for PIE),1 (for RED)]	(not important if L4S is used)
c=scalable cc used [0,1]		(not important if L4S or PIE is used)
d=number of low-latency flows [integer]	(not important if L4S is used)
e=number of classic flows [integer]	(not important if L4S is used)
f=reference delay in ms [double]	(not important if L4S is used)
