The standard ns-3.26 has only the kernel version 2.6.36 included
For the installation of other kernels see

My changes of the kernel are based on the version 4.7.0-rc5 from the tutorial above

inet_ecn.h
Move to the include/net folder of the original kernel code
Changes the ECT(0) to the ECT(1) bit

tcp_ipv4.c
Move to the net/ipv4 folder of the original kernel code
Makes the kernel dump the congestion window into the kernel log file

tcp_dctcp.c
Move to the net/ipv4 folder of the original kernel code
Changes the DCTCP congestion control to Relentless
