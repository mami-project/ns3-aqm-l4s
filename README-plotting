compare-[ccC,ccL,ecn](-lte).py
Comparison plots for differen congestion controls on classic flows and low-latency flows and for ECN turned on or off on classic flows for normal and LTE case.

plot-per-flowconf-[dq,dq-sca,l4s,sq](-lte).py
Plots performance for distinct flow configuration for Dual Queue (Uncoupled) with and without scalable congestion control, DualQ Coupled (L4S) and Single Queue for normal and LTE case.
Arguments are 'number of low-latency flows' [1,5,10] and 'number of classic flows' [1,5,10] in that order.

plot-per-tcpconf-[dq,dq-sca,l4s,sq](-lte).py
Plots  performance for distinct TCP configuration for Dual Queue (Uncoupled) with and without scalable congestion control, DualQ Coupled (L4S) and Single Queue for normal and LTE case.
Arguments are 'classic congestion control' [reno,cubic], 'low-latency congestion control' [dctcp,relentless] and ECN [0,1] in that order.
